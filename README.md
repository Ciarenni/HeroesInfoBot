# HeroesInfoBot
Twitch chat bot for providing info about Heroes, Abilities, and Talents from Heroes of the Storm

The ultimate idea for this is to have the bot running as a service that broadcasters can put into their channel by going to the bot's channel and executing a command.
Once the bot is in the channel, users can use it to get information about Heroes, Abilities, or Talents with a format similar to [[Ability Name]] to get information about any Abilities or Talents that have that name. A user could also do [[Hero Name/Talent tier]] to get the information of the Talents available to the Hero at that Talent tier. Tier is used instead of level because of Heroes like Chromie that get their Talents at different levels. I would like to eventually remove this restriction, but that probably won't happen for the inital build.

The info is pulled from another Github that updates the Hero/Ability/Talent info with every patch.

You might say "Hey, this is like the HeroesInfoBot on the subreddit." You're exactly right, that's what gave me the idea at all.
